Home page: home.html (click "Cookies" to go to product browsing, the cookie image to go to product detail, shopping cart to go to cart)

Product browsing: product-browsing.html

Product detail: product-detail.html

Cart page: cart.html



New features: adding/subtracting quantities of items, changing the frequency, removing items (on cart page), number next to cart reflects number of items in cart; all use local storage and classes

Small tweaks: added text under images on product-browsing page, added image and text when there's no items in cart on cart page

Flow:
1. Home page - can click on Cookies tab (product-browsing) or the featured cookie image
2. Product browsing - click on chocolate chip cookie (product-detail)
3. Product detail - can adjust the number and subscription period, then add to cart
4. Cart - view item added to cart, adjust it, remove it from cart
Note: number in top right corner should reflect number of unique items in cart
