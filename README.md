Description: This is my personal website and a visual representation of a resume with more personalizations. It adjusts to screen size and has simple animations. While rudimentary and simple now, the target audience for the future will be recruiters.

Using the site: ____________________-
starting on index.html
- click "works" in navbar
    - click "projects"
    OR
    - click "photography", scroll down
- click "about" in navbar

External libraries: I used Bootstrap because it adds interactivity to my site, particularly the adjustable screen size function and navbar. I also added small animations for feedback (e.g. hover highlights). ____________

Iteration: I made two prototypes on Figma because I thought the first one would be too simple, but the second idea was too complex animations-wise, so I stuck with the general flow of the first one and tried to keep the font and color theme similar to the second.

Major challenges: I had issues with animations (4/21 - still stuck). ______________
